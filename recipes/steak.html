    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound and 1 1/4" thick New York Strip</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Thyme</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Rosemary Springs</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
    <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
    <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
    <li>Add butter – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
    <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
</ol>
