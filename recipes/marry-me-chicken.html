        <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Dredge the chicken in seasoned flour, and shake off any excess flour. Transfer to a plate but do not stack the chicken as they will stick to each other.</li>
    <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan on medium heat, heat the oil and melt the butter.</li>
    <li>Brown the chicken on both sides until it’s golden brown, transfer onto a warm plate, cover, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Saute the garlic for a minute or until it’s fragrant. Add the chicken stock, and deglaze the pan scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. 
        Add the heavy cream and the parmesan cheese to the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes, then season with chili flakes and oregano</li>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper to your taste, add the sundried tomatoes then put the chicken back in the sauce and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes</li>
    <li>Marry Me Chicken is now ready! Just garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves and serve warm over pasta or rice</li>
